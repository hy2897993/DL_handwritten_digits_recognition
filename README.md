# Deep Neural Networks Model on MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition

Deep Neural Networks are becoming more and more popular and widely applied to many ML-related domains. In this project, I will complete a simple pipeline of training neural networks to recognize MNIST Handwritten Digits: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Iâ€™ll implement two neural
network architectures along with the code to load data, train and optimize these networks. I will also run different experiments on your model to complete a short report.
